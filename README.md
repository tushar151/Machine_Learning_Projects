                                              MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This project recommends top 5 movies which are similar to the movie given by the user.It is an example of Reinforcement Learning where it learns based on the previous recommendations and improve itself on the future recommendations.I have also created a website using Streamlit module ehich provides an interface for the user to input the movie to get the recommended movies.
